  ## Description
  Tired of convenient, easy to use, expensive GUI's for updating and managing your company's inventory?  Would you like to ensure that the task of managing your company's inventory is as tedious and cumbersome for your minimum-wage paid employees as every other demeaning task you expect of them? Do you value making sure your expense budget is in the black so you can guarantee your next quarterly bonus?  Allow us to introduce you to E-bae™ Baby!  Modern software not only allows your employees to possibly have some free time to slack around, but it's costly as well.  We cut the costs of using a front-end frame work and pass a fraction of those savings on to you.  Not enough to outweigh the inconvenience of using our program, but enough that you'll buy ours to save a buck.  It's not like you're going to have to use this program, that's what your expendable retail worker is for!

  ## Installation
  You will need to make sure you install all the dependent node packages needed for this application to function correctly.  As a business owner, we know that's all gibberish to you.  Just tell your field IT guy (you know, your cousin's kid who dropped out of that coding bootcamp) to remember to "npm i".  You'll seem WAY more knowledgable than you actually are, and it's all about perception right?
  
  ## Usage
Since we spared you the cost of paying for ANY front end frame-work, our program will have to be utilized in conjuction with Insomnia (or any fast REST client).  Don't worry, it's free!  After that, just select the API call you want to make based on the corresponding CRUD methodology and pre-set Model.  If you're average retail worker looks blankly as you explain this to them, go ahead and have them start calling your company's tech support now (since you've chose to purchase this software that call volumes will be "higher then average")†.

* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed

actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
